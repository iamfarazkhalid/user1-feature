readme.txt file for deliverable 2
Written by Nicolette

This deliverable is built upon the broken code that was submitted for deliverable 1
For this project, the type of socket must be defined in the last variable entered on the command line. "UDP" or "stream"

Nicolette attempted to communicate with the group multiple times to deligate tasks.
Everyone picked and agreed to respective tasks on Tuesday

Afham and Faraz took parts 1-3 with the promise of being done by Wednesday or letting the group know.
Not only did they not finish, we have not heard anything from them since. The rest of the group believes
that they have given up and are no longer going to be helping with the project.
One text was recieved by Nicolette from Faraz asking about the echo_c part and who was in charge of it. Nicolette's attempts at responding/helping were met with silence

Syed and Emnet took parts 4 & 5. Only contact has been with Emnet, complaints about not knowing how to start, and any attempt at helping them has been meet with silence. 

Nicolette and Kent took parts 6-8. They met several times throughout the week to work on the Deliverable
When they finished, Nicolette started working on other files such as the Makefile and the readme file since
it did not appear as if anyone else was even going to finish their respective parts.
Nicolette added the pieces of code to server_function.c that has her name by the comments, and modified the entirety of log_s 
which was based on code pulled from the tutorial website. There should be a comment at the top of the file saying this and giving a link to the website.
She also modified server_function.h because one of the functions was missing from deliverable one
Kent researched on the socket tutorial website to find what functions did what and how their syntax worked. He also deciphered code as Nicolette
was writing it to minimize mistakes/bugs.

The Makefile was written by Nicolette and Kent. Changing names of files and making sure files had their .h files as dependencies

Friday Kent and Nicolette decided to try and do the other parts of the project by themselves since the rest of the group did not seem to be working on it at all.
Kent took parts 4&5 while Nicolette attempted parts 1,2&3. 
Sunday Kent and Nicolette met up once more to try and get everything collected together for submission.
They texted the group multiple times (as this was the agreed upon form of communication), but recieved no response.
Nicolette gave parts 1-3 her best shot before helping Kent with parts 4&5.

Faraz and Afham did upload code late Sunday night for echo_s, but the code did not have all the parts necissary and could not be used.
No changes were made to the client code except for changing its name to echo_c because no other changes were needed. No changes were made to the client function files

No testing could be done under the time constraint.

Basically the entire project was written by Nicolette with help from Kent in areas.



this is the readme file for deliverable 3
written by Nicolette Railsback (user_6)
the github repository being used was created by the username iamfarazkhalid
the name of the repository is user1-feature

Faraz is user_1
Afham is user_2
Syed is user_3
Emnet is user_4
Kent is user_5
Nicolette is user_6

this project was built from the code used for deliverable 2.
the code assumes that the -logip and -logport are not entered during the calls

users 1,2,3, and 6 met Friday(4/28) night to start the project. (Faraz, Afham, Syed, and Nicolette repsectively)

user_1 (Faraz)
Faraz uploaded the Deliverable 2 code to Github, he then wrote the changes into echo_s before uploading the new content to github

user_2 (Afham)
Afham downloaded the code from github, made his changes, and reuploaded. During the changing process, Faraz realized he had switched some numbers in
	his portion, and they were updated for this branch.
	we had a little trouble figuring out how to make a new branch on Afham's machine
	we realized that Faraz needed to give Afham coloborator status on Github, and then Afham needed to be working inside the 
	directory that was coppied from the remote repository when he tried to make a new branch
	the next hurdle was remembering to add the changed file to the staging area and commiting before pulling down the master branch to merge

	user_3 (Syed)
	Syed downloaded the code from github, made his changes, and reuploaded.


	users 4 and 6 met Saturday (4/29) afternoon (Emnet and Nicolette)

	user_4 (Emnet)
	Emnet downloaded the code from github, made her changes to echo_s.c, server_function.c, server_functions.h, and log_s.c, then reuploaded to github


	users 5 and 6 met Saturday evening (Kent and Nicolette)

	user_5 (Kent)
	Kent downloaded the code from github, made his changes to log_s.c, and then reuploaded the code to github
	Emnet and Nicolette had forgotten to close the log.txt file in that if statement, so Kent fixed it


	Saturday night user_6 finished writing the readme and uploaded the final project to github as well as the readme to eLearning
